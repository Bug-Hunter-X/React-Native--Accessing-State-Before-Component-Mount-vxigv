This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before the component has fully mounted.  It's often seen when using asynchronous operations within the component's lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { data: null };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        // Trying to access 'this.setState' before component is mounted
        this.setState({ data }); 
      });
  }

  render() {
    // This will throw an error if data is accessed before it's set in setState
    console.log(this.state.data); 
    return (
      <View>
        {/*Conditional Rendering based on data*/}
        {this.state.data && <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text>}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
